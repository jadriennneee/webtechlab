	Advocacy is a process for a cause to influence public policy in social, economical, political, etc. 
in order to bring about justice and positive change in human rights and environmental issues. 
Advocacy on Environmental Protection involves both protecting the public from environmental 
hazards and protecting the natural world. 


Our advocacy is to raise awareness not only to the people but also to the children who will be our future leaders, 
awareness that our environment is in need of much attention.
Environment is also a part of God's creation so we do not want to put in into waste because of us people who are 
irresponsible of our own actions.
