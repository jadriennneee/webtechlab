ENVIRONMENTAL
One of the most challenging responsibility of any community is sustainability. 
This roots to a more complex issue which is protecting the environment. 
And this results to a lot of responsibility. We cannot deny that 
has given as pure milestone of innovation but environment should 
never be forgotten as we go along. 

Our advocacy is to raise awareness not only to the people but also to the children who will be our future leaders, 
awareness that our environment is in need of much attention.
Environment is also a part of God's creation so we do not want to put in into waste because of us people who are 
irresponsible of our own actions. As an individual of a community, it should start within us. 

Let us explore and enhance the knowledge of fellow communities on ways of protecting the 
environment by sharing how local people of Asin protect their environment.
