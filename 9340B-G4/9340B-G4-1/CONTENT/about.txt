GOOD GOVERNANCE
Spiderman once said, “with great power comes great responsibility”. 
This quote has played a big role not just on movie screens and your 
favourite movie channel but also on the lives of an elected official. 
It gives meaning to what they do on a daily basis. 
But not all has the capability to bringing it into life. 
Some may say more than what they do, while others do more than what they say. 
Some practice what they preach and some just preach without practicing. 
That’s the difference between two people involved in politics. 
From the biggest officials to the smallest unit of a government, the barangay. 

Our advocacy? it's simple: "To the Barangay officials, Be the Start of Something 
New". With this in mind, we challenge all other officials out there to improve 
the way how they implement things just as what we had done to Barangay Asin.

We advocate good governance in such a way that we make people, specifically other 
officials, aware of what should be done in order to have an efficient and effective
implementation 



This what we all know is good governance. 
This page is advocating the good in governance, 
so let’s seat back relax, read and be inspired to what Barangay Asin has to offer…
