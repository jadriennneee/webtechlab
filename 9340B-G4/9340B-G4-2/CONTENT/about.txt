CULTURAL


Culture, from what we know, is when ancestors pass on the things that they have learned and the skills that they have
acquired. With this in mind, we advocate preservation
of the culture that was passed on to us.

Passed through generations from ancestors to ancestors,  
Asin has set a high standard with their local product in wood carving. 
This, in return, open doors to youth on how to become independent 
by profiting in it. This makes them functioning young individuals to 
reach higher for their dreams. Passing on tradition by way of involvement.
Learne ho Asin keeps their tradition alive by involving the youth in the 
process of preservation.
